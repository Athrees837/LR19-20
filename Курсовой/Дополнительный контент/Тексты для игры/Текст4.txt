This morning I get up at a half past six o'clock. It's still dark. I feel tired. I went to bed at 1 am and did not sleep enough. If a person doesn't sleep eight hours, it's unhealthy, I know. But today I take an exam. It starts at 9 am and I have to take a 7-hour bus if I want to arrive on time. I'm going to take a cold shower, to have a big coffee before getting there.
